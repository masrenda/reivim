# Renvim dotfiles

It's still in the overall lunarvim configuration, but I customised it slightly for my daily needs. <br>
I've set this up for Vue, Nuxt, and PHP developers.

> _For some reason, the HTML tag element in Vue and PHP didn't work before, so I got around it a bit by re-stacking the HTML tags in one place._ > <br>

> **Warning** - Never try to costumise the `~/.local/share/lunarvim/lvim` folder
