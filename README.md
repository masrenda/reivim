It's still in the overall lunarvim configuration, but I customised it slightly for my daily needs.
</p>

## Feature Costumization by me:

### Plugins

- [live-server](https://github.com/manzeloth/live-server)
- [neosolarized.nvim](https://github.com/svrana/neosolarized.nvim)

### etc

- HTML snippets for Vue and PHP
  > For some reason, the HTML tag element in Vue and PHP didn't work before, so I got around it a bit by re-stacking the HTML tags in one place.

### Reference

- theme: [Takuya's dotfiles](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public)
